        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a second-year student at UCR en route to graduate early with a degree in psychology. I have participated in four lab research projects. I am interested in pursuing a career in Industrial-Organizational Psychology (I/O Psychology). I currently have plans to pursue a masters degree in I/O Psychology and hope to use that degree to land a job in the field. The are of study inside this field I am especially interested in is the social dynamic between employees and the work they are doing, especially if they are in a position where they have to stare at screens all day and receive little to no social interaction. 
In the next couple of months my hope is to get an internship for the summer of twenty twenty three and get some experience in the filed while I prepare to apply to graduate school. I am a full-time student and I am currently working part time at a Starbucks near my home to finance my education and hope to begin making money in my field so I can eventually leave retail/ fast food behind. At Starbucks I have recently been promoted to shift lead and with that I have learned a lot in employee management and the finances of running a business. <br><br>

        In my spare time I am an avid reader - I enjoy reading several types of book especially ones in psychology. The last book I read was entitled 'The man who mistook his wife for a hat' by neurologist Oliver Sacks. The book essentially described the history of some of Dr. Sacks patients. The book has inspired me and the research I want to do in the future. I hope to one day be able to write a book - not necessarily on any patients but on what I have learned on the field and any interesting stories i might gather throughout my life. 
I am a first generation college student and first generation American. With that I am extremely self motivated to do my best in every project and endeavor I find myself a part of. I hope to fill my life with people and connections who have served me well and helped me build my career. I hope to gain enough experience that I am able to eventually pass it on to other students like me in the future who are uncertain in their life choices and who have been affected by social and life struggles such as myself. 
In ten years my biggest hope is to have begun making a name for myself in the psychological field and to have finished my schooling so that I can pass on what I have learned. I am going into my 20s this year and throughout this decade I want to really get myself situated in my life and in my career. I plan to further my education and continue to develop my skills to be able to apply them both in my career and in my social life. <br><br>
